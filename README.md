Here's how to make it work

2. navigate to `about://extensions` in your chrome browser

3. check `developer mode` at the top of the page

4. Click `Load unpacked extension`

5. In the file picker that pops up, go to the `url-shortener-chrome-extension` folder and
   press OK. 

6. The extension will pop up in your extension toolbar, and you can click on it to use it.
